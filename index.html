        </li>
        <li class="w3-padding-16">Not many apps today have live feedback where the person reading the child’s story can respond, or the child listening to a story can relate. Other apps give tips and advice on how to cope with the problems they might deal with. This app addresses all problems that a child 11 to 13 might be dealing with.</li>

        </li>
        <li class="w3-padding-16">We have designed an app that allows kids with any sort of problems they might have to listen to fictional and non-fictional stories, these stories can relate to all sorts of real life scenarios where they might need help. This will allow them to find where the problem is and cope and or fix it.

        </li>
        <li class="w3-padding-16">Our app is more targeted towards kids from the age 11 to 13 as that’s where they start to use phones and download more apps, that’s also the age where they start to grow up and realize changes being made in their life and might need help understanding what solutions they need to their problems.</li>

    <h2>MARKETING STRATEGY</h2>
    <p>The app is completely free to download, and we do not sell our users’ data. We make money on a freemium business model. Free users are welcome to access most of the podcasts but will have audio ads (visual ads will take away from the user interface). Premium users will pay $1.99 per month for the ability to download podcasts, have access to all of the podcasts, and have no ads.</p><br>
    <p>Social media marketing and word-of-mouth marketing are likely to be the two most important facets of the marketing plan. Social media is cheap to use and appeals to the parents of our ultimate consumers. We will be aided by both organic word-of-mouth marketing (authentic, traditional word-of-mouth marketing) and amplified word-of-mouth marketing. Our amplified word of marketing plan is a referral system where every referral unlocks exclusive podcasts for free users and discounts for premium users. This will accelerate word-of-mouth marketing. Word-of-mouth is appropriate for our app because it is completely free, and suggestions from friends and family are seen as more genuine.</p><br>
    <p>Most importantly, not all children have access to their personal computer or a smartphone; we must get the parents involved in order to let these potential users get involved. Instead of ads, parents trust apps which the teachers and the schools recommend. We can contact primary school boards and children's mental health NGOs and let them recommend our app to the parents if they believe it is worth downloading.</p><br>
    <p>Users will be randomly asked on occasion to fill in a short quantitative survey. Survey questions will be specific to the visual design of the app and podcast details. These two facets of our team’s vision are key to creating a product tailored to our unique target market. The additional exclusive podcasts or discounts on subscription will also be used as incentive for completing feedback surveys.</p><br>
    <p>The nature of our “post-it” comment box on each podcast episode allows for a seamless way for users to submit suggestions. Our team views, considers, and responds to each and every suggestion. Not only does this allow for our podcasts to be better in the future and our app to have new and improved updates, but it lets the users know that their opinions are valued.</p><br>

<h2>Research Article</h2>
<h4>Podcasts and Mental Health</h4>
<p>By Ryan Salman</p><br>
<p>Since the rise of online streaming media such as YouTube or Twitch, podcasts have become a predominant aspect of our daily lives as members of the first generation. They had to adapt and learn to live with the Internet daily.</p><br>

<p>Despite being available for almost 20 years, we just realize the potential of podcasts to impact the mental health sector, especially for teenagers who have already unconsciously integrated podcasts and other aspects of the internet media in their life, as experimental results and therapists feedbacks have ensured the power of cohesion and social support for what concerns treating mental illnesses. 
</p><br>

<p>Our project relies heavily on this specific word: cohesion. Around the ages of 11 to 13, teenagers pass through many changes at the morphological and psychological scale; they start doubting themselves, questioning everything, and most importantly, they start worrying about being the only ones to experience this. Here comes the problem: "You are not alone in this!" Very few have the mental strength and the self-assurance to express themselves and share their thoughts, which makes it more or less of a stigma in the current society. However, we have realized that people tend to be more confident behind a computer screen and, most importantly, protected by the anonymity that the web offers. A second critical point is the negativity teenagers experience when they are going to this transformation phase. 
</p><br>

<p>In fact, around this age, many of them start feeling excluded from the society and disliked (almost hated) by their surroundings, which doesn't help accommodate the already burdening changes they are experiencing. Our product's idea is to make that connection between teenagers, so they don't feel excluded anymore; our main interest is to create an anonymous bound between them and the podcasters, so they understand that what they are passing through is essentially rational and very common among teenagers their age. </p><br>

<p>For the negativity part, that is where the podcasters come into play; their role is to orientate the discussions, diffuse the negativity by focusing on sharing positive thoughts and teaching these teenagers how to manage their emotions and to look for the bright side of things to surpass the difficulties. 
</p><br>

<p>The large variety of categories and episodes allows this product to be all-around and cover almost all kinds of mental illnesses without necessarily having to reach out for help from a therapist (which most teenagers are usually afraid of). </p><br>

<p>The possibility of sharing thoughts and commenting on the podcasts allows teenagers to interact, share, and form a sensation of social safety; that is what we mean by cohesion. 
</p><br>

<p>When we face a problem alone, we feel powerless, and we tend to surrender to this vast and threatening monster that is displayed in front of our eyes; when we face it as a group, we find out that this threat was a shadow, a non-existing problem that has been tiring us and draining us from our energy and positivity, we end up surpassing it, together, and that forges self-assurance and resilience for the future, because, indeed, we are ever all alone. </p>
